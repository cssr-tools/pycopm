abstract = {The Open Porous Media (OPM) initiative is a community effort that encourages open innovation and reproducible research for simulation of porous media processes. OPM coordinates collaborative software development, maintains and distributes open-source software and open data sets, and seeks to ensure that these are available under a free license in a long-term perspective. In this paper, we present OPM Flow, which is a reservoir simulator developed for industrial use, as well as some of the individual components used to make OPM Flow. The descriptions apply to the 2019.10 release of OPM.}

abstract = {This paper presents a closed-loop workflow for short-term optimization of reservoir management powered by offshore wind energy. Motivated by the need to reduce CO2 emissions in the Norwegian oil and gas sector, the workflow integrates wind power forecasts into optimization of daily well control while adhering to a long-term production strategy optimized for economic output. The workflow utilizes coarsened reservoir models calibrated through ensemble-based data assimilation to minimize computational costs. A realistic benchmark model, Drogon, is used to demonstrate the methodology. The workflow dynamically adjusts well rates to align power demand with wind availability, minimizing reliance on gas turbines and thereby reducing emissions. The numerical experiment demonstrates the potential of the workflow by significantly reducing short-term emissions without compromising the NPV.}

	abstract = {There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders---representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers---have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

abstract = {The Open Porous Media (OPM) initiative is a community effort that encourages open innovation and reproducible research for simulation of porous media processes. OPM coordinates collaborative software development, maintains and distributes open-source software and open data sets, and seeks to ensure that these are available under a free license in a long-term perspective. In this paper, we present OPM Flow, which is a reservoir simulator developed for industrial use, as well as some of the individual components used to make OPM Flow. The descriptions apply to the 2019.10 release of OPM.}
